It's easy to focus on the number of 3rd-party tags, how large a page is, or even its Lighthouse score, but fundamentally performance is about our visitors' experience – how quickly it loads, how smooth it is to use.

In this talk we'll examine what affects our perception of performance, how we can speedup visitor experiences and some of the common issues Andy comes across in his day-to-day work.

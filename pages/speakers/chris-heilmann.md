  bio: |
    <p>Chris Heilmann dedicated the last 20 years of his life to make the web work and thrive. As a lead developer on some of the largest web products he learned that knowledge is not enough without teamwork and good handover. He dedicated most of his time since on educating, writing and sharing, presenting on average at 30 conferences a year. He strives to make code and coders work efficiently. He is the author of several JavaScript books and the <a href="http://developer-evangelism.com">Developer Evangelism handbook</a>. He is currently a Senior Program Manager in Microsoft and spends a lot of time pondering how machine learning and AI can aid humans and replace jobs we're too important to do.</p>

Something isn't working out. We drown in excellent tools and information about how to build great content for the web. And yet what is out there is in dire need of optimisation. Making it easier for developers to create more quicker isn't the solution. Neither is offering a _"web alternative"_. Coming up with fixed rules and quotas doesn't work either. People try to fulfil them rather than building great user-centric products. Let's offer our years of knowledge as a guide instead, maybe that will do the trick?

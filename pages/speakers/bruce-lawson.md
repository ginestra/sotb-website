You’re a PHP ninja. You’re a React god. You’re a magician with Sketch. But if your code is assembling HTML to get delivered to a users’ browser, how much do you know about HTML’s semantics?

Choosing the correct HTML elements rather than vomiting a "div" or belching out a "span" can greatly enhance the end users’ experience, with no fragile extra code to write and maintain. That's why HTML is an acronym of "How To Make Loveliness".

One of the co-editors of the HTML5.3 spec will take you on a magical treasure hunt around HTML, showing you marvellous gifts and hidden wonders that will also help future-proof your code, and turn you into a time-travelling Frontend Superhero, adored by millions. (Actual number not guaranteed. But your users will be happy.)

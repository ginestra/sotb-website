  bio: |
    <p>Rowan is a Developer Advocate for the web at Google where he mostly focuses on driving the adoption of web platform features in e-commerce. Mostly this means looking for ways to match up neat platform features with good business metrics, or more simply: good web == good business. Outside of talking shop, you can always ask him about terrible horror films - especially if you have some terrible 80s pulp to suggest.</p>

As the capability of the web as an app platform expands the distinction in functionality between web and native apps becomes blurrier. At the same time, native platforms like Android are offering more dynamic ways to deliver previously monolithic app downloads. We’ll take a tour though the state of play today - from PWAs to Instant Apps through to a peek at future architectures. From a user, developer, and business point of view we’ll see how to weigh up these options when working out what to implement today.

  bio: |
    <p><a href="https://laurakalbag.com">Laura Kalbag</a> is a British designer living in Ireland, and author of <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone">Accessibility For Everyone</a> from A Book Apart. Sheâ€™s one third of <a href="https://ind.ie">Indie</a>, a tiny two-person-and-one-husky not-for-profit working for social justice in the digital age. At Ind.ie, Laura follows the <a href="https://ind.ie/ethical-design">Ethical Design Manifesto</a>, and works on a web privacy tool called <a href="https://better.fyi">Better Blocker</a>, and initiatives to create ethical alternatives to mainstream technology.</p>
    <p>On an average day, Laura does everything from design and development, learning how to run a sustainable not-for-profit, and trying to make privacy, and broader ethics in technology, accessible to a wide audience. You can find her making design decisions, writing CSS, nudging icon pixels, or distilling a privacy policy into something humans can understand. Sometimes, she speaks at conferences and writes articles too.</p>

Who do we really benefit with accessible technology and why do any of us bother at all? This talk will explore the motivations for our work, how to overcome some of our most common failings, and where inclusive design fits in our processes, approaches, outlooks and lives.

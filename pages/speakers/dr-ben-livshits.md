[Brave](https://brave.com) is a browser that aims to disrupt online advertising, while simultaneously protecting the privacy of the user. Brave tends to also be quite a bit faster that the competition.

In this talk I will describe some of the novel browser features, such as a cryptocurrency wallet, an ad system, and our push to enable interesting interactions with what some people call Web 3.0.

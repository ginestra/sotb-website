presentation_title: "Stop the #divFest!"
presentation_description: |
    Frameworks are awesome, right? JSX and templates are the best thing since sliced bread!

    Problem is we stopped taking semantic into consideration and started the #divFest and not everything is a div or neither should it be.

    This has huge implications for both accessibility, SEO, and just code readability in general, it's also something we can fix with just some tricks.

    In this talk I will focus in React and Vue but these ideas can be used in any framework you choose to use.

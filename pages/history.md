This will be the 7th State of the Browser and London Web Standards 11th year.

In 2011 London Web Standards organised a one day conference focusing on the _‘State of the Browser’_ at Ravensbourne. The Event was attended by 140 web professionals. The event was streamed live over the internet and at its peak was watched by over 200 people.

The conference was then repeated in 2012 and 2013, with 175 delegates. In 2014 we moved to our new venue, the lovely, historical Conway Hall, in Red Lion Square, Holborn.

In 2014 and 2015 we had close to 400 attendees.

In 2016 we took a year off and returned in 2017.

State of the Browser and London Web Standards is not and never has been about money, _we are all about the community_. Which is why we aim to keep the cost of the conference to a minimum just cover our costs.

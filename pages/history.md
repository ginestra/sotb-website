This will be the 7th State of the Browser and London Web Standards 11th year.

In 2011 London Web Standards organised a one day conference focusing on the _‘State of the Browser’_ at Ravensbourne. The Event was attended by 140 web professionals. The event was streamed live over the internet and at its peak was watched by over 200 people.

> Honestly I think that was one of the best conferences I've been part of

The conference was then repeated in 2012 and 2013, with 175 delegates. In 2014 we moved to our new venue, the lovely, historic Conway Hall, in Red Lion Square, Holborn.

In 2014 and 2015 we had close to 400 attendees.

> I felt the talk slots were timed and scheduled well and it was an honour to be part of the panel at the end

In 2016 we took a year off and returned in 2017.

> I'm trying really hard to think of what you could do better next time!

State of the Browser, and London Web Standards, is not and never has been about money we are all about the community. Which is why we aim to keep the cost of the conference to a minimum just cover our costs

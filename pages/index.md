## State of the Browser is back!

We shall be announcing <a href="/speakers" rel="internal">Speakers</a> soon, but you don’t need to wait to grab a ticket.

### About State of the Browser

_State of the Browser_ is a one-day, single-track conference with widely varying talks about the modern web.

### Who are London Web Standards?

London Web Standards brings together web professionals who are working for a better web. Our monthly meetups provide them with an opportunity to teach, inspire, learn, network and debate. Each meetup features a speaker drawn from our membership or the wider standards community. The talks cover a range of topics including HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, accessibility, web fonts, UX and front-end performance.

### History

In 2011 London Web Standards organised a one-day conference focusing on the &ldquo;State of the Browser&rdquo;, at Ravensbourne. This was attended by 140 web professionals. The conference was streamed live over the internet and at its peak was watched by over 200 people. _State of the Browser (SOTB)_ was then repeated in 2012 and 2013, with 175 delegates. In 2014 we moved to Conway Hall in Red Lion Square in central London and _SOTB_ was attended by almost 400 people. We took a year off in 2016 but returned to Conway Hall in 2017, as we will again this year!

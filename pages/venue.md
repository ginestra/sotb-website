## Conway Hall

> Conway Hall is and always will be the place for those who dare to dream of a better world.

<a href="https://conwayhall.org.uk/">Conway Hall</a> is owned by Conway Hall Ethical Society and was first opened in 1929. The name was chosen in honour of Moncure Daniel Conway (1832 – 1907), anti-slavery advocate, out-spoken supporter of free thought and biographer of Thomas Paine.

The Hall now hosts a wide variety of lectures, classes, performances, community and social events. It is renowned as a hub for free speech and independent thought.

The Library holds the Ethical Society’s collection, which is the largest and most comprehensive Humanist Research resource of its kind in the United Kingdom.

Conway Hall is located at [25 Red Lion Square, London WC1R 4RL](https://goo.gl/maps/HL9XGSxDgxu).
